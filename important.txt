itscreams and new_oven work together 
- together they have a working FSM and TIMER
- lack pwm and load_X issue 

it hollers and new new oven fsm 
- have a possibly working pwm controller 

alternatepwm.asm and alternate oven .inc 
- have another version of a possibly working pwm controller  

otherpwm.asm and otheroven.inc 
- tests another version of pwm impelmentation 

- this last one is most likely to work
